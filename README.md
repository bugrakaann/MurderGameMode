Welcome to Murder Game Mode Project! Here, I've created an exciting game modification (mod) based on a different original game. This mod introduces new features, improvements, and enhancements to elevate the gaming experience. I aimed to successfully transfer Garrys Mod Game Mod into Rust. This game mode reorganizes networking logic of the game and overrides default logic. That allows us to increase performance by modified networking logic. Admin Panels and lobby UIs added into game for better experience.
